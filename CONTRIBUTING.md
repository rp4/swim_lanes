### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/rp4/swimlanes/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/rp4/swimlanes/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes

```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and test them:
```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm test            # Run tests
npm run lint        # Check linting
npm run type-check  # Check TypeScript
```

3. Commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
```

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
* `feat:` New feature
* `fix:` Bug fix
* `docs:` Documentation changes
* `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc)
* `refactor:` Code refactoring
* `test:` Test changes
* `chore:` Build process or auxiliary tool changes

4. Push to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

5. Open a Pull Request

### Testing

We use Jest for unit testing and Playwright for E2E testing:

```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Generate coverage report
npm run test:e2e        # Run E2E tests
```

Writing tests:
* Place unit tests next to the code they test
* Use `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix
* Write descriptive test names
* Aim for >80% code coverage

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
npm run lint        # Check for linting errors
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix linting errors
npm run format      # Format code with Prettier
```

Key style guidelines:
* Use TypeScript for type safety
* Follow functional programming principles where appropriate
* Keep functions small and focused
* Write self-documenting code with clear names
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Documentation

* Update README.md if needed
* Add JSDoc comments for public functions
* Update API documentation for new features
* Include examples for complex features

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:
```
feat: add export to PDF functionality
fix: resolve connection line rendering issue
docs: update installation instructions
```

## Release Process

We use semantic versioning and automated releases:

1. Merge PRs to `main` branch

3. Creates GitHub release and npm package
4. Updates CHANGELOG.md
